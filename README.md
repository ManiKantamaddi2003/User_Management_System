- **Other Libraries/Tools**:
  - JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library for dynamic content rendering) 🔧

## 📚 Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-system.git
```

### 2. Set up the database:
- Open MySQL and create a new database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE user_mgnt;
```

- Use the following SQL query to create the necessary table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

### 3. Configure your server:
- Configure the connection settings for the database in your Java backend code.
  
### 4. Run the application:
- After setting up the project, you can run the application on your local server (e.g., Apache Tomcat).
- Navigate to the main page and start managing users!

## 🧑‍💼 How It Works
- **Admins** can log in and perform CRUD operations on users (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **Users** can be managed through an intuitive UI with features like searching and sorting.

## 🎯 Goals
- To provide a simple yet powerful user management system.
- To integrate seamless user authentication for administrative functions.
- To create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## 📸 Screenshots
- **Homepage**: Displays user data in a table with options to add, edit, or delete users.

## 🔑 Future Enhancements
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different types of users (admin, normal users).
- Improve the UI design with modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular.
- Add email notifications on user addition, deletion, or updates.
